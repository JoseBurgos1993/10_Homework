# 10_Homework
For this assignment, I was tasked to create a Team Profile Creator application. I used Inquirer to probe the user for information on the team manager, and any engineers or interns that are in the group. The application will then create a new html page that shows off the team.

The github repository is [here](https://github.com/JoseBurgos1993/10_Homework). Here is a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/122HSzc2diuBOVoP09RgWRimd5jNP5Xf5/view?usp=sharing) that demostrates the application in action.

## Usage
The application will prompt the user multiple times. Type out exactly what you want for each section. The resulting .html file will be located in the /Develop/output folder.
